// pickKey is what automation compares releases by when choosing the best one:
// the language first (a release with no language tag or only English before
// one that adds another language, whatever their quality), then the quality
// tier (its rank in the profile's own order, so the qualities of a group tie
// and are told apart by the built-in order), then the profile's preferred-term score. Equal keys are settled by
// preferOver (indexer priority, protocol, then a cached release).
//
// cached sits between the tier and the score, and is only ever non-zero when
// the person allowed "a lower score for a cached release": a cached release
// then beats an uncached one of the same language and tier whatever the score.
// It never lifts a release over a better language or tier.
//
// A torrent its indexer reports with no seeders at all is dead: dead goes
// below everything else, so it is only picked when nothing alive is left, and
// among two otherwise equal torrents the one with more seeders wins (see
// preferOver). A release whose seeders are not known is never counted as dead.
