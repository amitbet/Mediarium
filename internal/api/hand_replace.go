// A release a person picked by hand (Choose a release) and agreed to replace
// the title's file is an explicit decision: the title's "Better versions"
// setting and "If a file already exists" decide for automatic grabs only. The
// swap is as careful as any other replacement:
//
//   - the new file is written next to the old one under a temporary name and
//     is only used when it is complete (the old file is not touched until then);
//   - the old file and the files named after it go to the recycle bin (when it
//     is on) and the new file takes the old name, or the old file is replaced
//     in one rename (when the bin is off, as "overwrite" does);
//   - if the last step fails, the old file is put back;
//   - a file that another movie or episode has down is never replaced, and
//     nothing outside the library folder is touched.
//
// A new file with another name than the old one is imported the usual way and
// the old file goes afterwards (removeReplacedFile), once the new one is in the
// library.
