// Size checks. Two simple rules, so nobody has to fill in a size table:
//
//   - A built-in minimum per quality catches fakes and samples: a "1080p
//     Bluray" movie of 40 MB is not what it says.
//   - A quality profile may set the largest release it accepts (MaxSizeGB),
//     for people with little disk space or a slow line.
//
// A release whose size the indexer did not report (0) always passes.
